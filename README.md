Postman API to control EMC storage devices

Since Dell migrated the Unisphere WebUI from Flash to HTML5, they dropped service tasks for older arrays.
This Postman collection handles some simple querying tasks as well as all standard service tasks such as reboot SP, reimage SP, shutdown system, etc.

The PWD variable needs to be updated in order to function.

* This has only been tested on VNXe 1600.
